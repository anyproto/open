# Template for a repo ready for contributing

## Steps
To make an Any Association repo ready for contributing do the following:

- `.github`; create a folder if it doesn't exist
  - `workflows`; create a folder if it doesn't exist 
    - `cla.yml`; add a CLA bot by copying the file
- `README.md`; update file by adding `Contribution` section from `README-addition.md`, ensure that you use the correct license name
